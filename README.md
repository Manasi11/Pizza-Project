3.	Login.jsp – used for existing user login. Connected to User table and validates the user’s password and login id from the database.
4.	Footer.jsp – for implementing footer consistently throughout the website.
5.	Menu.jsp – contains pizza menus. Displays the menu pizza items from the database.
6.	Admin.jsp – this will appear when admin logins and will be redirected to index when admin logsout.
About Us is the HTML page which includes information about the system.
I have created 2 tables, User and Menu. 
User table is updated from front end when user signs up all the information is stored in it. Same table is user for login page to validate the user.
Menu table contains pizza menu database with its name id price and size along with the image for the pizza.
